Well done on finding this page, it's not like I deliberately haven't included any links pointing here. Just so you know, I have used Jekyll to make this - [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Above standard Jekyll, I gave used the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme. It's pretty fun to be fair, has all the functionality one would expect, of which a small fraction I've figured out how to use.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
