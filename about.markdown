Hi there, I'm Jay, and I'm an undergraduate studying some joint honours subjects which both delight me and frustrate me at times.

A little about me:
- I was born an Indian citizen in the UK, and moved to Norwich for most years of my school education apart from a year or two here and there.
- I really like mathematics and everything that can be done with it.
- Decided to continue with it at university, and hopefully I end up with a job that lets me leverage my maths in the coolest way(s) possible!

I've also got a LinkedIn, as you do, where you can find some of my work-oriented self-descriptions if you want, but that's all quite serious. This webpage is meant to be much more light-hearted and not to be taken too seriously :).

By the way, I made this site using Jekyll and host it using GitHub pages.
