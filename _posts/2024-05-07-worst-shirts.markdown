It did not go well.

### Why on earth does the quality of shirt matter
To be honest, I don't get this either. After all, as long as I'm wearing a shirt that works, _surely_ it'll all be fine.

### What happened
At the school I've been at, since it's the final year and I'm a prefect and all (a fairly senior one at that), basically I am allowed to wear whatever colour 'formal' shirt I want to.

Not caring (and therefore not willing to put the effort in), I decided it was in my best interests to just stick with the classic white shirts I'd always worn; unfortunately, I ended up deviating from this policy on a handful of occasions, ~7 by my count.

Due to never having a high profile, I just sort of assumed people wouldn't notice. In any case, I always made sure I wore an ironed shirt.

Astonishingly, when the time came for _prefect awards_, it transpired that people had noticed my lack of effort and quid pro quo... I was awarded shirts. (To be honest, I'm actually a little proud of it)

### P.S.
If my time as prefect sounds dull based on just this little, rest assured - it was!

However, in a student leadership capacity at school with academic remit, I did do some good stuff including run the student lecture series for a year - managing timetable, speakers, etc - and invited a Government minister (Rt Hon Chloe Smith MP, former head of the DWP) to give a well-received talk.
