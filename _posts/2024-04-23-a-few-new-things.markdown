It's been a while since my last post, and don't expect many more too soon...

## What's been on
Life.

As per usual, life just had to go and get in the way. When I say that, what I really mean is school - lot's of it!!

From A levels to STEP to, well A levels, the stuff I've been up to feels a bit mundane as I'm typing this paragraph, but hopefully I remember some more exciting things a bit later (you can see if I did by checking the contents list). I'll try and cover the main things that have gone on since November-ey times up till now. This I'll do for whoever may dare read this, but largely for my own sanity :) - something I've been told I don't have a lot of left.

### The UCAS application
Along with most of the country's eighteen year olds, I also decided to submit a UCAS application way back when in October and universities eventually got back to me, though some did want to do some extra tests just to size me up.

In summary, I applied to 5 places:
- Oxford for MathCompSci
- Imperial for MathCompSci
- Warwick for MORSE (basically MathStat)
- Durham for MathStat
- Bristol for MathCompSci

Of course, the ones was most keen on were Oxford, Imperial and Warwick. This is mainly because Durham and Bristol are a bit far from from (plus all the stuff about the actual courses of course). Only did attend open days for these three so I can't be certain of course and would not want to unfairly dismiss Durham or Bristol. Funnily enough, I eliminated Bath as a potential option since I heard there was a big hill in the city whcih made cycling annoying.

As part of my application, I wrote a personal statement as the main part of it that I could really pour my heart into. More on this in a bit including maybe a few quotes from the finished thing since I do still feel pretty proud of it, maybe part of that irrational hesitation to move on from things a lot of time went into.

Anyway, before any decisions actually came through, and even before any application deadlines, I had to do some mathematical admissions tests. In my case, I did 4, which felt like quite a lot at the time and likewise retrospectively. In fairness, the preparation for these has definitely stuck with me long-term as a mathematician to enhance my problem solving and has put me in good stead for the upcoming STEP exams I'll be soon to do.

## Admissions tests
As mentioned I did 4, and am yet to sit an additional 2 papers at the same time as A levels:
- MAT (main)
- MAT (extra due to a TCS mess-up on the main)
- TMUA
- Imperial proprietary
- STEP 2 & 3 (upcoming)

### The MATs
This was the test I put most effort into, indeed spending a lot of the previous summer preparing using past papers, old STEP I papers, and whatever else I could get my hands on... to be honest I don't remember much else about the paper except for the fact that I liked some of the questions.

Unfortunately, I was in the first batch to sit this test in a new 'hybrid' format (see [here](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test) for details). Predictably, that all went wrong on the day nationwide (I got locked out twice). Hence we had an 'extra' MAT of 10 multiple guess questions in addition. What else is there to say.

Scores: 83/100 on the main MAT and 8/10 on the extra.
### TMUA
This was a day before the main MAT, and I s'pose I entered it partially as a warm-up for MAT, as well as to get more favourable offers from Warwick and Durham. Questions were challenging but simultaneously quite satisfying. In the last cohort to have done this test under CAAT, I was sort of expecting examiners to give us the most awful questions possible as a 'fitting send off' for the exam, but thankfully it went alright but I'm kinda sad they still haven't released the papers, keeping them under embargo for no knowable reason.

Anyway got 8.0 in that overall putting me in the top 5% or so of all test takers so was decently pleased with that
### Imperial's proprietary
Since I applied to the DoC, they didn't consider MAT and instead mandated some kind of proprietary test, which I was instructed to sit on 16 October '24. As there were no past papers, it was quite scary but turned out alright with questions varying from pseudocode analysis to combinatorics and graphs, and even touching on logic.

Turned out that a friend of mine also sat the test on the same day for the same department and **hypothetically** it emerged that Imperial had a clever system in place to keep the general style of question the same between candidates but eliminate systematic cheating by switching up small details here and there. Pretty cool and a very good idea imho.

### STEP (upcoming)
Doing this as part of my offer conditions and pretty nerve-wracking with it being at the same time as A levels (one day before Physics 2 in fact). In fairness all I need is a 2 in paper 2, but I want to beat that and also experience STEP 3 (hopefully that decision making makes sense).

Really would quite like a couple of 1s (or better if I dare to dream) but would be happy with anything that satisfies the offer.

Anyway, now the fun stuff:
## Universities
Just a bit about the next stages / decisions from each really
### Oxford


### Imperial


### Warwick


### Durham and Bristol
Got the offers (A\*AA) but not really interested in these. Declined them in the end. Not to say they aren't good universities, but just not for me, sorry.
