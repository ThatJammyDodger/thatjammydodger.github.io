Hi!

My name is Jay and at the time of writing, I'm an A level student living in Norwich. My subjects include Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Chemistry although I quite like Computer Science as well, having written research essays on Cryptography and the Fourier Transform (which I plan to upload in future).

I've also done some messing around with C# on various projects such as attempting to build an app and predicting the motion of a spinning wheel. Sadly, not all my projects get to a super-polished state due to the time commitments that have been imposed by wanted to do well in my A levels and GCSEs.

Have a look round this site where I aim to do some occassional posting and hope you enjoy.

By the way, if you have any burning comments about anything I've written, feel free to contact me at ambadkarj123@gmail.com, though I can't guarantee I'll respond!

Best wishes and happy scrolling, Jay
