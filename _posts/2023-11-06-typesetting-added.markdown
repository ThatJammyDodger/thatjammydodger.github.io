After an entire two minute investigation into potential libraries, and based on nothing other than the library's sponsor list, this site's admin has decided to use <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a> to implement mathematical typesetting around here.

I'll be using this on future posts so that I can make my maths look professional even if it might not really be. Upcoming features might include my take on the scalar product for vectors or using Tschirnhaus transformations to solve cubics. Or maybe some things I liked/ didn't like about MAT 2023...

In any case, just to prove that I have done a thing, here's a lil bit of maths for your entertainment:

<div>
$$ax^2+bx+c=0 \implies x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
</div>

<div>
$${ \sin(A) + \sin(B) = 2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right) }$$
</div>

<div>
$$\textnormal{For}\hspace{0.5cm} t=\tan\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right), \hspace{1cm} \cos\theta=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.$$
</div>
