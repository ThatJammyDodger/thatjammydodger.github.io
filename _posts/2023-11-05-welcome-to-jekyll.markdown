Not much idea what's going on here sadly :( 
Would quite like to add LaTeX support on here in the near future if I get time (and begin to understand what is going on!)

Here's a code snippet describing my work algorithm:

{% highlight ruby %}
def do_work():
  do_STEP_or_MAT_problems()
  more_challenge_problems()
  if (time_remaining):
    some_programming()

while (time > 08:00 && time < 01:00 && !tired && !schooltime):
  do_work()
  eat_food_or_snack()
  rest_a_bit()

sleep()
{% endhighlight %}
