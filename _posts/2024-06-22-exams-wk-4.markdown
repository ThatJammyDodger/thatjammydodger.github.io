Mwah ha ha...

## Summary
Another busy week full of **stuff**. Busy studying, not much time to go around

### The penultimate five

|Day   | Exam ref.   | Thoughts   |
|:--- | :---: | :--- |
| Monday | **H556 / 03 / Unified Physics** | Yikes! Tricky stuff, especially near the end. Not a bad paper though - would have been better if I'd understood the 6 mark question first time. |
| Tuesday | **H432 / 02 / Organic Chemistry** | Whoo! Pretty much easy marks imo, except for some dilly mistakes I made. |
| Wednesday | **9FM0 / 3A / Further Pure 1** | Easy marks. Slightly terrifies of the grade boundaries though. <br> However, I must now declare my newfound grudge on the person who phrased the vectors question. |
| Thursday | **9MA0 / 03 / Stats and Mechs** | Evil stats contextual questions,  need I say more? |
| Friday | **H432 / 03 / Unified Chemistry** | Mwah ha ha ha ha, time for me now to brew some truly awesome chemicals >:) |

Positivitiy innit
